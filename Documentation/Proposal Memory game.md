# Memory
### Intent
The intent of this proposal is to create a game called memory that digitizes the well know analog version of the card game where the players try to guess where two matching cards are in the playing field while the card is up-side down. 

### Features
The game would have the following features:
- A gameplay where the player(s) can choose cards from a playing field
- A settings screen to change the game settings e.g. a theme, time limit, maximum number of misses or the number of cards in a set (ranging from 2 up to 4 cards per set)
- The player can choose between practivce, where he/she can choose between a practive on a timelimit or on a maximum number of misses, and a challenge game where both varieties are increasingly make the game more difficult. Both the practice and the challenge will also become more difficult by adding more cards on the screen, starting from 8 cards up to 20 cards.

### Sketches
The following screens would be visible for the player:

# Memory
### Intent
The intent of this proposal is to create a game called memory that digitizes the well know analog version of the card game where the players try to guess where two matching cards are in the playing field while the card is up-side down. 

### Features
The game would have the following features:
- A gameplay where one or more players can choose cards from a playing field
- A settings screen to change the player settings
- A selection of different themes
- A setting to increase the number of card-sets in the screen ranging from 8 up to 20 cards
- A setting to change the number of cards that need to be guessed (minimum 2 cards, maximum 4 cards per set)
- An activity with game statistics displaying the number of played/won/lost games in with each of the settings

### Sketches
The following screens would be visible for the player:
